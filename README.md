##Atlanta Public Transportation MARTA Website Redesign

**Designed by Nachiket Kumar //
Developed by Cynthia Yeung**

This partner-paired project was introduced in the Fall 2012 quarter at 
SCAD-ATL for course GRDS 384: Web Design instructed by professor Holly 
Quarzo. In this project, each student paired designed his/her own project
and handed it off to their partner to develop. 

GRDS 384 focused on best practices for web design emphasizing user-centered
design. Project objectives involved identifying user problems, personas, 
wireframing, usability testing, and implementation. This is the final developed 
design. 

### Problem
- - - -

**The current MARTA website is not based on user centered design.** I have never used it and felt happy or that my answers were easy to find. Iâ€™ve always felt that like many public transit websites, this one too suffers from lack of usability. My gut instinct is, and this would need some sort of testing to validate, that most users come to the site to figure out a small handful of things: **Does MARTA service their route, and if it does, what is the schedule. This needs to be prominent in the design of the website.**

### Personas
- - - -
1. **Megan Jones, 52**
	Goals: Finding out fare information, train and bus schedules	Technical Level: Megan spends a lot of time on the computer at work but she is most comfortable in the software used for her job. It takes her a long time to get used to a new interface or program, and while her kids forced her to get a smartphone, she rarely uses any other functions but the call button!
2. **AJ Rao, 35**
	Goals: Finding train timings, breakdowns or service interruptions that will affect his journey.
	Technical Level: AJ is very comfortable using technology- he has a smartphone and a tablet, as well as a laptop computer. He uses his smartphone to look up information on the go. While he is comfortable using technology, he still appreciates a well designed interface that makes his time on the site easier.
3. **Kwame Amuleru, 22**	Goal: Getting from point A to point B within Atlanta using the MARTA system.
	Technical Level: He is not extremely tech savvy. However, he does own a smartphone and uses it to look up information. As a visual person, he places a lot of importance on the look of a site or an app, which makes it easier for him to figure out the functionality.
###Usability
- - - -Although the personas described for the MARTA website redesign have similar goals in locating specific information, they vary in technical level. User usability testing was important because it expanded to a broad demographic of users.
The following goals were evaluated by a usability test
* To ensure that navigation structure is clear, logical and intuitive* To ensure users are able to find and use the trip planner intuitively* To ensure users can find the home page on a different page* To ensure users can easily find the careers page and fare information.* To ensure that users can find a way to contact MARTA.
###Design
- - - -MARTA website redesign was designed using the 960 grid. There are primarily four different layouts throughout the website. The use of the grid system and consist layouts helped the website look organized and user-friendly. In total, phase 1 had a total of 22 pages.
Advanced elements utilized in this website include:* CSS3 Accordian Styled FAQ* Javascript Drop Down Menu* Embedded videos using HTML5 Video Player* TypeKit
